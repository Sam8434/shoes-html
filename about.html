            <p>Footwear is a human made outer covering of foot. When the human beings came into existence, they were required to protect themselves from, cold dampness, dust, heat, and roughness of ground while standing, walking or even running. So they originate shoes for the protection of their feet. It is conventionally made out of leather but the aforesaid can be made with synthetic material. The importance of footwear is highly realised in western and other countries, so the footwear industry developed in full motion that originated companies like Nike, Adidas, Puma, Reebok etcIn recent years, there has been a temperament for the footwear sector in the developing world to become successful in exporting to industrially advanced countries. Local markets in developing countries for domestically produced footwear have also grown. These latest trends have resulted in the entrenchment of relatively large scale and capital intensive plants. Domestic enterprises with less access to technical information have thus tended to adopt manufacturing methods similar to those in ‘turn-key’ factories, at the expense of technologies more suitable to local conditions, especially at low scales of production. In western countries especially in Europe, the footwear industry has declined in the last few years. While in 2005, there were about 27.000 firms engaged in footwear industry; in 2008 there were only 24.000. Along with the number of firms, the direct employment has also decreased. The only factors that remained almost steady were production value and the value added at factor cost.

                In the United States, the annual shoe industry revenue recorded in 2012 was $48 billion. There are around 29.000 shoe stores in the United States and the footwear industry employs about 189.000 people. Due to increasing imports, these figures are also declining. The only way of staying alive in the shoe market is to establish a presence in niche markets.</p>
